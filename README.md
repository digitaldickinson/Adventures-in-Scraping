# Adventures-in-Scraping
Short investigations and exercises related to scraping web pages. These will ultimatley find there way into workshops, classroom exercises or blog posts
I'm trying to keep a bit of a hyperlocal theme to my work, so the examples are going to be specific to small areas or come off the back of issues that would be of general interest to hyperlocal and community content creators. The choice of scraping a parish council website for example is deliberate as transparency legislation begins to come into force for the lower levels of local government. Data journalism skills that would work at city, bourough or county council level are becoming more relevent at the very local level too. 

Please feel free to drop me a line if you want to know more, spot errors or have any suggestions.
